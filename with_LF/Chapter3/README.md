#### Note

There are three versions of the code from listing 3-2

- verbatim: As the book presents the code - lacking the necessary header `#include` lines
- clean: As the book presents the code - including the required headers to compile and build
- greenonline: A couple of additional notes regarding `WaitNextEvent()`, so pre-System 7 compatible
